This project is a Pac-man game that uses a graph as a data structure in order to find the shortest routes between ghosts and Pac-man. It is presented as a final project in the course of algorithms and data structures in the second half of 2019.

The objective of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible by eating dots, power-pellets(energizers), fruits, and blue ghosts. When all of the dots in a stage are eaten, that stage is completed, and the player will advance to the next. The four ghosts roam the maze and chase Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touches Pac-Man, a life is lost. When all lives have been lost, the game is over.

You can change Pac-man direction using either <b>WASD</b>, <b>IJKL</b> or the arrow keys.
